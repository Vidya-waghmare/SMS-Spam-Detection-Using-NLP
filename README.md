## Overview
This project aims to detect spam in SMS messages using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. The project leverages machine learning models to classify messages as spam or ham (non-spam).

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project is the **SMS Spam Collection** dataset, which contains 5,574 SMS messages labeled as spam or ham.

## Features
- **Tokenization**: Breaking down text into individual words or tokens.
- **Text Preprocessing**: Cleaning and normalizing text data.
- **Feature Extraction**: Converting text data into numerical features.
- **Model Training**: Training machine learning models to classify messages.
- **Model Evaluation**: Evaluating model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Usage
1. Clone the repository from your preferred source control platform.
2. Install the required packages.
3. Download the dataset and place it in the `data` directory.
4. Run the script to train the models.
5. Run the script to make predictions.

## Models
- **Multinomial Naive Bayes**
- **Support Vector Machine**
- **Decision Tree Classifier**

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates the effectiveness of NLP techniques in detecting spam in SMS messages. Future improvements could include experimenting with different machine learning algorithms and fine-tuning hyperparameters.
